# Warmup

The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

##### What model device did you test your application on? What SDK did you target? #####
> The device is a Lenovo Tab 2 a10. The SDK that I targeted was Android 5.0 Lollipop target version 21


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Around 3-4 hours


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I got some help from Raymond Duong, Chau Ngo and Ivy Wong while working on this homework assignment. I also got help from Slack


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> The main problem I had was that I couldn't step through the code in Android Studio since it was all greyed out. As result, debugging was a harder task. I think it would be great if we could see our outputs compared to the expected outputs. This would help me solve the test cases that I was failing.
